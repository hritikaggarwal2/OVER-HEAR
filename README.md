# OVER-HEAR

## What the App does?

Over-Hear is an android mobile app that was invented as an effort to increase the accessibility by providing hearing-impaired people a means to interact normally with other people without the need to learn sign languages or lip-reading techniques. The app notifies the user when anyone in the vicinity calls their name out. As soon
as the app registers the user's name being called out, it vibrates the smartphone and pops-up a notification. The user can
click on this notification to go to the app, where the app converts speech-to-text in real time for the user to comprehend
and reply to. All the user has to do is enter their preferred name when they use the app for the first time.

It's simple. It's convenient. It's intuitive. It's accessible.
